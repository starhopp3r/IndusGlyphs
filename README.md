# IndusGlyphs

To support the development of a text-to-Indus script converter, a frequency analysis was conducted on translated substrings and their corresponding Indus glyphs, based on the work of [@yajnadevam](https://github.com/yajnadevam/). The resulting frequency table is available as a PDF file in the results folder.
